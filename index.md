# Welcome!

Hi! My name is Devon, and I'm a freelance translator with more than ten years of experience. 
In my time as a translator, I've worked with a variety of media including short stories, television, 
musicals, tabletop RPGs, and video games, but the bulk of my experience has been with manga.

## My work

I've done work for a number of clients across many genres, targeting both print and digital. 
These are just a small number of examples of my work.
